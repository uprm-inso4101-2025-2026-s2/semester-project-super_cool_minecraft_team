== 1.4. Needs and Ideas

    We identify that many Minecraft mods rely on other mods, libraries, specific loaders, and specific Minecraft versions in order to function correctly. When dependencies are missing, incompatible, or incorrectly ordered, the game often fails to launch or crashes during runtime. 

    There is a significant lack of accessibility in dependency documentation. Currently, users are forced to parse technical plain text, which is particularly exclusionary for younger audiences who make up a large portion of the Minecraft community. Furthermore, most mods do not display dependencies or incompatibilities clearly on their main mod pages. We want to change this experience for users to save them from the frustration that leads them to abandon the idea of using Minecraft mods because they do not understand the underlying technical issues.

    There is, therefore, a need to develop a mod dependency visualization platform that represents mods as nodes and dependencies as directed connections. The platform will allow users to select a mod and view which mods depend on it and why it is required. The team will develop a comprehensive web-based platform designed to transform the way Minecraft players interact with mod configurations. The approach is to move away from text-heavy logs and provide a Dynamic Dependency Graph. This will make conflict detection visual and easy to manage for all users.

1.8 Assumptions and Dependencies

    - Assumption A: Reliable access to Minecraft mod metadata sources is available during development.
    
    Dependency: The project depends on these sources to design and test dependency parsing and resolution logic.

    Risk: If metadata access is disrupted or formats change, development may be delayed while adapting the tool.

    - Assumption B: The project’s requirements and scope will stay consistent during the development phase.

    Dependency: Design choices and implementation plans depend on stable requirements to minimize the need for rework.

    Risk: Major changes may affect the schedule and necessitate adjustments to key components.

    - Assumption C: The necessary development tools, environments, and test data are accessible and correctly set up.

    Dependency: The team depends on these resources to develop and test the dependency tool.

    Risk: If these resources are unavailable or improperly configured, progress may be delayed and errors could be introduced.

1.9 Implicit and Derived Goals
    - Goal 1: Simplify and automate the management of Minecraft mods and libraries to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible, reducing errors and manual configuration for users.

    - Goal 2: Provide a reliable system for detecting version conflicts and missing dependencies, enabling mod developers and players to maintain stable modpacks without technical troubleshooting.

    - Goal 3: Offer optional features such as dependency visualization and compatibility suggestions to enhance user experience and improve modpack maintenance efficiency.

2.3 Requirements
    - Requirement 1: Fetching dependencies of mods, this could be created with fabric API for maximum efficency and modularity.
    - Requirement 2: Fetch the "breaks" in the mods for comparing with dependencies in the modpack and indicate if some mods are incompatible, coul use fabric API too.
    - Requirement 3: Open the mod packs and read the content for the fetch functions. Needs to read each mod individually to check for the "breaks".
    - Requirement 4: Pass the data to the other layers of the project to be used on the graph and display.
    - Requirement 5: Storing the dependencies needed and the mods passed by the user.
    - Requirement 6: Merge the dependencies and "breaks" for comparate and identify the incompatibilities.
    - Requirement 7: The platform must associate each dependency with exactly one dependency type: required, optional, or incompatible.
    - Requirement 8: The platform must represent dependencies transitively, such that dependencies of dependencies are included.

2.5 Domain Entities
    - Mod:
        Represents a Minecraft modification that extends or alters the base game functionality.
        A Mod contains metadata such as its name, version, supported Minecraft version, and declared dependencies.
        Each Mod may depend on other Mods and may also declare incompatibilities.
        It is the central entity of the system and serves as a node within the dependency graph.
        
    - Dependency:
        Represents a directed relationship in which one Mod requires another Mod in order to function correctly.
        A Dependency specifies the required Mod and any version constraints associated with that requirement.
        It is responsible for defining mandatory relationships between Mods and enabling validation of mod configurations.

    - Incompatibility:
        Represents a conflict relationship between two Mods where they cannot coexist in the same mod configuration.
        An Incompatibility defines which Mods are incompatible and may include version-based conditions.
        It is responsible for identifying and signaling potential runtime conflicts within a mod set.

    - Modpack:
        Represents a collection of Mods selected by a user to be used together.
        A Modpack aggregates multiple Mods and serves as the context for dependency resolution and conflict analysis.
        It is responsible for grouping Mods and enabling validation of their combined compatibility.

    - Dependency Graph:
        Represents the structured visualization of Mods as nodes and Dependencies as directed connections.
        The Dependency Graph models the relationships between Mods and provides a conceptual view of dependency chains.
        It is responsible for enabling analysis of required Mods, reverse dependencies, and structural relationships.

    - User:
        Represents an individual interacting with the platform to analyze Mods and Modpacks.
        A User can upload or select a Modpack, inspect Dependencies, and view detected Incompatibilities.
        The User initiates analysis processes but does not directly modify domain relationships.

2.10 Software Architecture Design

3. Analytical

3.1 Concept Formation
    The Team A domain sketch illustrates the operation of the Mod Dependency Analyzer tool.
    - Based on these observations :
        - Mod : an artifact software uploaded by the user.
        - Dependecy : relationship that indicates that one mod requiere another.
        - DTO : abstraction used to carry mod and dependecy.
        - Dependency Graph — structured network formed by interconnected dependency relationships.
    - Grouping decisions: libraries needed and mods needed for a mod to work are grouped as Dependency because both are prerequisites.
    - Conflicts : dependecy referes to both libraries and mods, graph refres to a data structure and not a visual representation.

3.2 Validation
The team validates the requirements and domain understanding through structured scenario-based walkthroughs. These walkthroughs simulate realistic modpack configurations and are discussed collectively to identify ambiguities, missing edge cases, or incorrect assumptions about domain concepts such as Mod, Dependency, Incompatibility, and Modpack.

The goal of validation is not to obtain approval, but to ensure that the system-to-be correctly reflects the domain relationships and user needs.

Scenario 1: Missing Mandatory Dependency

Context:
A user uploads a modpack containing Mod A, which declares a mandatory dependency on Mod B. Mod B is not included in the uploaded modpack.

Walkthrough Steps:

1. The system parses metadata of all uploaded mods.
2. The declared dependencies of Mod A are extracted.
3. The system checks whether Mod B exists in the modpack.
4. The dependency graph is generated.
5. Missing dependency is visually highlighted.

Validation Outcome:
During walkthrough discussion, the team clarified the distinction between mandatory and optional dependencies. The requirement was refined to explicitly differentiate these cases and ensure that only mandatory dependencies trigger critical warnings.

Scenario 2: Circular Dependency Case

Context:
Mod A depends on Mod B, and Mod B depends on Mod A.

Walkthrough Steps:

1. Dependencies are parsed.
2. The graph is constructed.
3. The system analyzes graph structure for cycles.

Validation Outcome:
A new requirement was added to explicitly detect circular dependencies and notify users when a cycle exists. The concept of “graph as structural model” was distinguished from “graph as visual representation.”
