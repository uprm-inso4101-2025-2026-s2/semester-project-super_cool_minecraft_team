== 1.4. Needs and Ideas

    We identify that many Minecraft mods rely on other mods, libraries, specific loaders, and specific Minecraft versions in order to function correctly. When dependencies are missing, incompatible, or incorrectly ordered, the game often fails to launch or crashes during runtime. 

    There is a significant lack of accessibility in dependency documentation. Currently, users are forced to parse technical plain text, which is particularly exclusionary for younger audiences who make up a large portion of the Minecraft community. Furthermore, most mods do not display dependencies or incompatibilities clearly on their main mod pages. We want to change this experience for users to save them from the frustration that leads them to abandon the idea of using Minecraft mods because they do not understand the underlying technical issues.

    There is, therefore, a need to develop a mod dependency visualization platform that represents mods as nodes and dependencies as directed connections. The platform will allow users to select a mod and view which mods depend on it and why it is required. The team will develop a comprehensive web-based platform designed to transform the way Minecraft players interact with mod configurations. The approach is to move away from text-heavy logs and provide a Dynamic Dependency Graph. This will make conflict detection visual and easy to manage for all users.

2.3 Requirements
# 2.3.2 — Personas

The following personas represent typical stakeholders who would use the mod dependency analyzer web application. They justify the previously defined epics and user stories.

---

## Persona 1 — “the Modpack Builder”

**Profile:**  
- 20–25 years old  
- Experienced Minecraft player  
- Builds custom modpacks for personal use or friends  
- Familiar with Fabric and mod loaders  
- Comfortable with technical tools but values automation  

**Goals:**  
- Quickly detect missing dependencies  
- Avoid version conflicts  
- Export a clean, ready-to-run modpack  
- Visualize how mods depend on each other  

**Frustrations:**  
- Manually tracking dependencies  
- Broken modpacks due to missing or incompatible versions  
- Searching multiple websites for correct download links  

**Why this persona matters:**  
Alex justifies features such as automatic dependency detection, graph visualization, conflict resolution, and modpack re-packaging.

---

## Persona 2 — “the Casual Player”

**Profile:**  
- 16–22 years old  
- Limited technical knowledge of mod loaders  
- Downloads modpacks from friends or online communities  
- Wants simple, reliable setup  

**Goals:**  
- Ensure all required mods are included  
- Fix missing dependencies easily  
- Avoid technical errors during installation  

**Frustrations:**  
- Game crashes due to missing mods  
- Confusing download pages  
- Not knowing which dependency version is correct  

**Why this persona matters:**  
Sam justifies features like automatic download fetching, clear dependency previews, and guided fixes for missing mods.

---

## Persona 3 — “the Server Organizer”

**Profile:**  
- 22–30 years old  
- Runs small multiplayer servers  
- Manages shared modpacks for a group  
- Needs consistency across players  

**Goals:**  
- Maintain a stable modpack  
- Ensure all players use identical mod versions  
- Quickly update packs when dependencies change  

**Frustrations:**  
- Version mismatches between players  
- Manual updates for every change  
- Lack of visibility into dependency chains  

# 2.3.4 - Interface requirements

- The subsystem must be capable of receiving dependency metadata from the Mod Uploading subsystem, including mod identifiers, version information, and declared dependencies.
- Queries to the Modrinth API (or similar repositories) should allow the system to locate required mods using dependency identifiers.
- Download URLs for compatible dependency versions must be retrieved and made available for installation.
- Structured results of the dependency resolution process are returned to the Visualization subsystem, including resolved dependencies, version matches, and any unresolved items.
- Notifications are provided whenever a required dependency cannot be resolved, ensuring the system or user is aware of the issue.
- Failed API requests should trigger automatic retries up to a configurable limit to maintain reliability.
- All interactions with external APIs are logged for debugging, verification, and auditing purposes.

# 2.3.5 – Machine Requirements

Performance:
- The subsystem shall process dependency resolution requests efficiently, ensuring reasonable response times for typical user workloads.
- The system shall handle multiple simultaneous requests without significant delays or system instability.
- Retrieval of download links for dependencies shall be performed in a timely manner to support smooth operation of the user workflow.

Reliability:
- The subsystem shall maintain continuous operation during normal usage, with minimal downtime.
- External API failures shall be handled gracefully, ensuring that partial failures do not crash the system or corrupt data.
- Errors and exceptions shall be logged to support debugging and verification.

Resource and Stability:
- The subsystem shall operate within reasonable memory and CPU usage to avoid affecting other system components.

Scalability: 
- The system shall be designed to accommodate growth in mod volume and user activity.
