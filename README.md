# Project Example

This is a simple example of a Springboot project with Thymeleaf templates, it uses Two Layers:
- Controller: It is responsible for handling the HTTP requests and returning the appropriate views.
- Service: It is responsible for the business logic of the application.

The project also includes a simple HTML template that displays a message to the user. The message is generated by the service layer and passed to the controller, which then renders it in the view.

The frontend developers can focus on creating the HTML templates and styling them with CSS, while the backend developers can focus on implementing the business logic in the service layer and handling the HTTP requests in the controller layer. This separation of concerns allows for a more organized and maintainable codebase.

To understand each layer and each piece of code in this project, you can follow the comments in the code files. The comments explain the purpose of each class, method, and variable, as well as how they interact with each other to achieve the desired functionality.

You can also use AI to ask specific questions about the code, such as "What does this method do?" or "How does this class interact with the service layer?" This can help you gain a deeper understanding of the code and how it works together to create a functional application.
